# The Reactive Machine website and documentation

This branch contains the assets used to build the website at https://microsoft.github.io/ReactiveMachine, including the project's documentation.

The documentation is generated from markdown using the Hugo tool. Both the markdown and the generated html are checked into GitHub.

## Editing the Documentation

**WARNING** only edit the files in the `Sources/` subdirectory - Any other files and directories are generated by the tool.

The documentation pages are in the [`Sources/content/docs`](Sources/content/docs) folder. Each document has three attributes:

* A `title`
* A `description` (supports Markdown)
* An optional `weight` field used to determine the order in which the docs are listed in the nav

The list of features listed on the home page is in [`Sources/data/features.yaml`](Sources/data/features.yaml). The `description` field supports Markdown.

The URL for the image on the main page is set using the `params.imgUrl` parameter in [`Sources/config.toml`](Sources/config.toml).

## Previewing the site 

You need to have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) installed. With those tools installed:

```shell
cd Sources
make serve
```

(or nmake if you are on Windows).


## Publishing the site 

You need to have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) installed. With those tools installed:

```shell
cd Sources
make production-build
```

You will be able to see the updated files in your git client, and you can check them in with the `gh-pages` branch. 
The hosted website is updated automatically by GitHub when the `gh-pages` branch is updated.
