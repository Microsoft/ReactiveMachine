# Examples

We have several example applications written using the Reactive Machine.

* **Hello World** The Hello World example serves to verify that youâ€™ve got the Reactive Machine built correctly and can get a basic service up and running. Further examples, like the Echo and Counter examples demonstrate features of the programming model.
* **Echo Service**  The Echo service example demonstrates how we can build an application that responds to events without the user having to consider failure, partitioning, routing messages or deployment details.
* **Counter Service** The Counter service example shows how you can leverage affinities at the application level for transparently routing messages and partitioning state for scalability without requiring the user to manually route messages or handle the partitioning of data themselves.
